what is a module?

A module is a file containing a set of functions that we might want to use in our application. Once we import a module, we can use all the functions defined inside that module.

Why modules?

You might have heard that Python is used for data analytics, web development, automation, etc.

To solve these tasks, we take the help of modules rather than writing code from scratch.

For example, if we need to perform tasks related to

data analytics, we will use modules such as NumPy, pandas, etc.
web development, we will use modules such as Django, Flask, etc.
csv files, we will use modules such as csv, pandas, etc.
