Object-Oriented Programming is a popular technique to solve programming problems by creating objects.

Classes and Objects
  There are two steps involved in creating objects:

1. Define a class
2. Create objects from the class


Lets say Student class has two variables
  name and
  score,
and a function check_pass_fail().

One thing to remember about classes is that they cannot store data. We can store data after we create objects from the class.

Think of a class as a blueprint of a house.
It contains all the details about the floors, doors, windows, etc. Based on these descriptions, we build the house.
The actual physical house is the object.




Creating Objects:
Once we define a class, we can create as many objects as we want from the class.

And, we store data in objects (not classes).

In the image, we have created objects student1 and student2 from the Student class.

All the objects of this Student class will have the
  name variable and the
  score variable,
and can use the check_pass_fail() function.


So when working with classes and objects
  variables are called attributes.
  functions are called methods.
